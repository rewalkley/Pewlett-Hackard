## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to determine the approximate number of employees retiring, and the number of employees eligible for the mentorship program. This analysis is to be grouped by position title, and delivered to Bobby's manager for review upon completion.

## Results

Below is a list of findings from the report:
* Pewlett Hackard potentially need to replace 90,000 employees that are in the age range for retiring (below is a list of employees by title)
  * ![Retirement Count png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80076110/116836555-934cff00-ab8c-11eb-997b-dfd486ca77ec.PNG)
* However, with this large amount of employees that are ready to retire, there are 1,500 employees that are eligible for mentorship, so Pewlett Hackard does not have to go outside the company to replace all retired employees at once.
* Most of the employees ready to retire are in the Engineering or Staff roles. Pewlett Hackard could focus on hiring more of those roles sooner rather than later in order to mitigate a loss of knowledge in those areas.
* The company can incentivize employees to stay on or leave earlier to help stagger the turnover of such a large quantity of employees all at once.

## Summary

In total, 90,398 employees will need to be filled; 29,414 Sr. Engineers, 28,254 Sr. Staff, 14,222 Engineers, 12,243 Staff, 4,502 Technique Leader, 1,761 Assistant Engineers and 2 Managers.

As stated above, 1,549 employees are eligible for the mentorship program. This will not replace all retiring employees, but it will help mitigate that turnover to an extent.
